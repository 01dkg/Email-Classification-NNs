# Email-Classification-NNs


## In the real world, many online shopping websites or service provider
have single email-id where customers can send their query, concern etc.
At the back-end service provider receive million of emails every week,
how they can identify which email is belonged of a particular department?
This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) model that is used
to solve this problem and experiments are carried out on user personal
Gmail emails datasets. This problem can be generalised as typical Text
Classification or Categorization [8].

## Keywords: Artificial Neural Network, Email Classification, Natural Computing, Text Categorization
